Lets explore AZURE!! 

We are going to need data....a LOT of data so lets do a few things: 
1)  Create a program that generates Data -not going to worry about normalization now...
    a) Persons 
        first name 
        last name
        full name (autogenerated)
        DOB
        Gender
        Person_ID (Autogenerated key)
        SSN (so we can play with secruity as well )
        (Not putting address on the person for now....)
    b) Orders (Physical Inventory)
        Order_ID
        Person_ID
        SKU 
        Quantity 
        Amount 
        Date 
        Offer_ID
    c) Interactions 
        Inteaction_ID 
        Person_ID
        Interaction Type (Web, IVR, Text, Phone, Agent)
        Interaction_Date 
        Location (State for now)
    d) Offers 
        Offer_ID 
        Offer_Date 
        Offer_type (Mail, Mobile, Web, Telemarket, Print)
        Offer_description (20%Off, 10%Off, BOGO, Cashback) 

2)  Generate data an save it to a local database 
3)  Export that data to Azure (TBD - try lake, cosmo, sql)
4)  Create some services around it (containerized) 
    - dont forget the logs 
5)  PowerBI reports
